SharePoint Process Helpers
=======

**This tool is under development and is not yet stable for production use.**

These process helpers greatly improve the user experience for processes in SharePoint. A process is something with a series of steps that runs through some sort of approval and review - everything from travel requests to annual reports.

These helpers were originally used in a large organization, automating a process with over 200 stakeholders. We are in the process of open sourcing them, so they can benefit others.

We are targeting SharePoint 2010 first, as it makes up the bulk of on-premise installations, but SharePoint 2013 and 365 support is likely in the future.

## Features

- One-click approvals
- One-click status changes
- Facebook-style discussion on an item
- Contextual guidance, which can be different for each step of the process

## Product roadmap

- Easier setup process
- SharePoint 2013 compatibility

Watch this repository for updates, and check out the [draft admin instructions](future_readme.md)] that will be polished before this is stable.
